### Expressive 2019 is officially co-located with Eurographics 2019!

We are officially co-located with Eurographics 2019 in Genoa. Expressive 2019 will start and end shortly before Eurographics 2019.

## Aims and Scope
{: .top1}

The _Expressive_ symposium explores the capacity of computer graphics, animation, and computational media to be used in artistic, aesthetic, and creative ways. The field can be seen as encompassing problems in expressive __understanding__, expressive __communication__, and expressive __interaction__:

* Expressive __understanding__ integrates aspects of computer science, philosophy, psychology, and the fine, applied, and performing arts, investigating theoretical approaches that further our understanding of aesthetic evaluation, perception and meaning.

* Expressive __communication__ focuses on imagery and motion which is expressive rather than photorealistic, although it may incorporate realistic elements.

* Expressive __interaction__ explores models, algorithms, and technologies for sketch-based interfaces, particularly classifying and recognizing hand-drawn shapes as a way to create or edit digital models, text, mathematics, or 3D shapes.

All accepted submissions will be presented in a single, unified track. This unification reflects the ongoing evolution of the symposium, which originated as the union of three separate events: Computational Aesthetics (CAe), Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering (NPAR), and Sketch-Based Interfaces and Modelling (SBIM). The symposium will also include an arts program, posters and demos, and presentations of published journal articles.
