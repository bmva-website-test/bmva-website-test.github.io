		  <p>Abstract:<br/>I discuss whether computers, using Artificial Intelligence, could create art. I review important points in the history of automation in art, examining the hype and reality of AI tools for art together with predictions about they will be used. The nature of current computer-generated art is discussion, and then it is hypothesized when we might ever credit an AI with authorship of art.</p>
