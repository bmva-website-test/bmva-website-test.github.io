One of the major activities of the British machine Vision Association (BMVA) is the organisation and facilitation of Technical Meetings on activities of interest to its membership. The meetings are normally one day meetings, held in a central London venue holding between 45 and 90 people. A chair or group of chairs in a specific area of machine vision proposes a meeting topic to the BMVA and the BMVA  then deals with the routine matters of organisation that are common to all meetings, while the chair is the person responsible for organisation of item such as technical programme and individual speakers.

## Subscribe to the BMVA mailing list

For up to date information on forthcoming BMVA meetings and events, subscribe to the BMVA mailing list by following this link: [Join the mailbase](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/bmva.html).

You do not need to be a member of the BMVA to attend one of our technical meetings. If you attend as a non-member you are automatically signed up to the BMVA for that year.

## Volunteer to chair your own meeting

We are currently **SEEKING VOLUNTEERS** to host meetings for Autumn 2019 onwards. 

This is not a hard task and involves:
+ Defining the format of the meeting
+ Organising a program of speakers (by a call for paper or invitation)
+ Chairing the meeting on the day and that is it!.

All other arrangements (finances, food, registration, room-booking etc.) will be taken care of by the BMVA. Please contact [Andrew Gilbert](mailto:a.gilbert@surrey.ac.uk) if you are interested in hosting one of the future meetings.

## â€‹Forthcoming Meetings
