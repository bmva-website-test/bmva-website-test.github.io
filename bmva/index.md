# Aims and Objectives
{: .top1}

The BMVA provides a national forum for individuals and organisations
involved in machine vision, image processing, and pattern recognition in the
United Kingdom.  Its principal aims are to:

+ promote knowledge of machine vision and pattern recognition
+ encourage practical applications of the technology
+ facilitate the rapid transfer of research results to industry
+ represent the UK machine vision community, nationally and
  internationally

## Activities

In pursuit of the above goals, the association's primary activities are:

+ The annual [British Machine Vision Conference](bmvc/index.html)
+ The annual conference on
      [Medical Image Understanding and Analysis](miua/index.html)
+ A series of [one-day technical meetings](meetings.html)
+ An [annual Summer School](summerschool.html)
+ Award of [travel bursaries](bursaries.html)
+ Award of [the Sullivan thesis prize](sullivan.html)
+ Maintenance of a [PhD thesis archive](theses/index.html)
+ Publication of the [_Annals of the BMVA_](annals/index.html)

and several [other activities](activities.html).
