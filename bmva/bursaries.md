In order to encourage UK postgraduate students to present work at
international conferences, the BMVA issues bursaries to help cover the travel
and conference costs. A number of such bursaries, of up to £750 each, are
issued annually. In return, the recipient is expected to write a report on the
conference for inclusion in [BMVA News](/bmva-news/), or equivalent work
for the BMVA website as agreed with the bursaries officer, and to present
their paper at a BMVA-organised meeting in the autumn.

To be eligible, you must be:

+ a student at a UK university;
+ a BMVA member;
+ presenting work at a major conference within the BMVA's remit.

To apply for such a Student Bursary, please write to the [bursaries officer](mailto:bursaries@bmva.org) enclosing:

+ A copy of the paper you are to present and acceptance status, whether poster
  or oral.
+ A breakdown of anticipated costs and details of your request (up to £750).
+ Confirmation from your supervisor of your student status and a statement
  that alternative sources of funding are not available (e-mail from the
  supervisor will be sufficient).

Bursary applications are considered shortly after a fixed number of deadlines.
You can submit applications at any time but your application will be
considered only after the deadline. The results will be announced directly to
applicants.  The deadlines are at the end of March, May, July, September and
November.

Preference is given to papers where the student is first author, to oral
presentations, and to students who have not already received a bursary. The
committee reserves the right to restrict the total number of bursaries awarded
for any one conference.

Students receiving bursaries are expected to acknowledge their receipt of a
BMVA bursary in their oral presentation or poster.

Successful applicants will be sent the agreed funds upon receipt by the
secretary of:

+ proof that the conference was attended;
+ original receipts;
+ a review for [BMVA News](/bmva-news/) or alternative contribution, to be decided in
  discussion with the bursaries officer;
+ a completed
  [claim form](http://breckon.eu/toby/bmva/expenses-claim.pdf). Fill out the
  form (leaving the "BMVA Committee Member" blank)

This must be done within two calendar months of the end of the conference.

## BMVC Bursaries

Special provision for student bursaries for BMVC (usually covering the cost of
the conference itself) are arranged each year by the BMVC organisers. For
details, contact the conference organiser or look at the
[BMVC web page](bmvc.html).
