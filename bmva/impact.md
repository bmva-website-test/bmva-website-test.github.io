The impact of research funded from the public funds is an important measure of
its value. In this context, 'impact' is principally the
transfer of knowledge from research to industry.

UK vision research has an excellent record in this context, with several
different types of interaction between the academe and industry: interaction
of academe with established companies, academe providing knowledge, expertise
and trained staff to companies, industry seconding academics, and companies
being spun out to exploit academic research. UK vision researchers also have a
good record of working with government agencies. Some examples of these types
of interaction are given below.

## Major UK vision companies

This is a subset of a longer list of UK vision companies.

+ [Oxford Metrics Group](https://oxfordmetrics.com): the parent of companies
  such as [Vicon](https://www.vicon.com), 2d3 and YottaDCL, Oxford Metrics
  sells vision-based technologies to a variety of industries. Several of those
  technologies are licensed from UK universities.
+ [Jenoptik](http://www.jenoptik.co.uk) (formerly Computer Recognition
  Systems): number plate recognition, traffic management
+ [VisionMetric](http://www.visionmetric.com): face recognition (EPSRC-funded
  research presented at BMVC2003) is now "used by 90% of British Police forces
  and also in thirty other countries worldwide."
+ [Image Metrics](http://image-metrics.com): facial animation

Companies such as these have stated that they rely on a regular supply of
highly-trained graduates computer vision experience from UK
institutions. Other vision-related industries that employ vision graduates are
the post-production and games industries, including companies such as EA,
Disney Black-Rock, Eurocom, Rare, Codemasters, Frontier, Natural Motion, The
Foundry, MirriAd, Framestore, The Mill, Aardman, but there are many more.

The skills learnt by postdoctorate researchers and PhD students working in
vision are valuable to companies working in other domains, for example: Dyson
(robotics), Morgan-Stanley (real-time computing), Ocado (robotics), Snell and
Wilcox (digital media creation, management and distribution), BAe Systems
(defence and manufacturing), Leonardo (defence).

Vision research in labs from major international companies

+ Microsoft (Kinect is based heavily on computer vision)
+ Hewlett-Packard
+ Sony Computer Entertainment Europe
+ Toshiba Research
+ Canon Research Europe
+ Sharp Laboratories of Europe
+ Google and Deep Mind

## Support for UK industry and agencies

UK vision research supports companies in a range of other areas:

+ Architecture, such as Buro Happold
+ Defence, such as Waterfall Solutions, BAe Systems
+ Pharmaceuticals, various inspection applications

Some specific examples are:

+ Oxford Brookes is working with Vicon, Sony and Yotta
+ Southampton is working with Nissan and Morpho (Sagem)

There is widespread support for CCTV analysis from HOSDB (CAST as of April
2011), in particular using
[the i-lids database](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/imagery-library-for-intelligent-detection-systems).

## Knowledge transfer activities

+ Demonstration of a gait biometrics system on the BBC's Bang Goes The Theory
+ [EPSRC Network on Vision and Language](http://www.vlnet.org.uk)
+ Joint meetings with the [Applied Vision Association](http://www.theava.net)

## Texts

Some of the leading vision texts have been written by UK researchers. These
include:

+ Roy Davies (Royal Holloway): _Machine Vision_
+ Mark Nixon (Southampton): _Feature Extraction and Image Processing_
+ Andrew Zisserman (Oxford): _Multiple View Geometry_
+ Simon Prince (UCL): _Computer Vision Models_

UK researchers have also written important books in disciplines related to
vision, such as:

+ Chris Bishop (Microsoft): _Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition_
+ David MacKay (Cambridge): _Machine Learning and Information Theory_

Two major international online resources for learning vision are also based in
UK academe:

+ HIPR2, an interactive vision textbook
+ CVonline, a compendium of vision techniques

## Future impact

The above all relate to impact that UK-based research has had in recent
years. However, the capabilities of computer systems have an important role in
determining what is possible and it is only very recently that they have
become fast enough, and with enough storage, to make such innovations
practical. Moreover, the miniaturisation of computing and (particularly)
sensing components that we have seen in recent years is opening up a host of
new application areas; and the increased sophistication of machine learning is
making possible more 'intelligent' vision systems. These are likely to have an
impact on everyone's lives in the next decade. Everywhere that humans see can
potentially be supported by computer vision.
