## Expressive 2018 is officially co-located with SIGGRAPH 2018!

We are officially co-located with SIGGRAPH 2018 in Vancouver that ends the day before Expressive 2018 starts.
Our conference venue is located in the beautiful city of Victoria, with only 30 minutes flight or 90 minutes driving from the SIGGRAPH venue in downtown Vancouver. Please take a look at the [**Venue**](./venue/) page for detailed travel instructions.

Expressive 2018 requires separate registrations from SIGGRAPH 2018. Please consult the [**Registration**](./registration/) for details.

## Aims and Scope
{: .top2}

_Expressive_ fuses three symposia centered on expressive aspects of computer graphics.

__Computational Aesthetics (CAe)__ integrates the bridging aspects of computer science, philosophy, psychology, and the fine, applied & performing arts. CAe investigates both tools to enhance the expressiveness of fine and applied arts, as well as theoretical approaches that further our understanding of aesthetic evaluation, perception and meaning.

__Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering (NPAR)__ investigates computational techniques for visual communication. Such techniques usually focuses on imagery and motion which is expressive, rather than photorealistic, although they may incorporate realistic elements.

__Sketch-Based Interfaces and Modeling (SBIM)__ focuses on the exploration of models, algorithms, and technologies for efficient sketch-based interfaces. It investigates the classification and recognition of hand-drawn shapes, and ways of using these techniques for creating or editing digital models, text, mathematics or 3D shapes.

These symposia were first held jointly in 2011, and continue to be integrated under the _Expressive_ umbrella.
