All work must be previously unpublished. Production and Meta papers need not contain original research or results, but must make a substantive contribution to the knowledge in the field. Papers should be 8â€“10 pages in length (excluding citations). Papers longer than 10 pages must make a very significant contribution. Supplemental video and images may also be submitted. Papers are reviewed double-blind and so must be anonymous when submitted. References to your own work should be made in the third person to maintain anonymity.

Technical paper submission is electronic using the [EasyChair system]({{site.symposium[2018].submission}}).

### Paper formatting

Manuscripts must be written in English. They should follow the [ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines](http://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors), including a title page with an abstract, keywords, and a bibliography. For formatting, please use the [ACM Master Article Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) with the _sigconf_ style.

* LaTeX (Version 1.49) [template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-master.zip).
* Microsoft Word [template for Windows](https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/acm_windows_word_template.zip).
* Microsoft Word [template for Mac 2016](https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/acm_mac_2016_word_template.zip).

The use of LaTeX is encouraged and preferred. However, only PDF files will be accepted for your submission. Please make sure that all fonts are embedded.

#### Setting up the LaTeX template

To setup the LaTeX template for anonymous submission, assign the _sigconf_ style in the document class as follows:

```
\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}
```

For the camera-ready submission, please remove the `review` and `anonymous` configuration of the document class.

Additionally, please set the conference details in the template as follows:

```
%Conference
\acmConference[EXPRESSIVE 2018]{the Joint Symposium on Computational
Aesthetics, Sketch-Based Interfaces and Modeling, and Non-Photorealistic
Animation and Rendering}{Aug.\ 17--19}{Victoria, BC, Canada}
\acmYear{2018}
\copyrightyear{2018}
\setcopyright{none}
```

For the camera-ready submission, remove `\setcopyright{none}` to comply with the ACM copyright policies.

### Supplemental material
{: .top1}

Supplemental material such as additional images or videos may be submitted as PDF or as a zipped archive (ZIP files) with a maximum size of 30 MB.

#### Video Formatting

Videos should be a maximum of 5 minutes in length and contain either clearly spoken English audio or subtitles. Please ensure that a commonly available format and codec is used. Suggested video specifications are: MP4 container format, with H.264 video encoding and AAC audio encoding. Videos can be converted into this format using freely available tools, such as [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/). Make sure that the video plays with [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), which is available on most platforms.
