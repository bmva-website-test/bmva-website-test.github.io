## Travel to the Expressive 2018 from SIGGRAPH

Expressive 2018 is officially co-located with SIGGRAPH 2018 this year, and begins the next day after SIGGRAPH 2018 ends. There are a few ways to travel to Expressive 2018 from the SIGGRAPH Venue in downtown Vancouver.

* By the Sea-planes. The sea-planes takes off in downtown Vancouver, right besides the Convention Centre (SIGGRAPH's venue) within walking distance and directly lands in downtown Victoria. There are two sea-plane operators that fly between Vancouver and Victoria:
  1. **Harbour Air Seaplanes** [(https://www.harbourair.com)](https://www.harbourair.com)
  2. **HeliJet** [(http://helijet.com/)](http://helijet.com/)
* By taking the regular flights operated by Air Canada, which fly from the Vancouver international airport (**YVR**) [(http://www.yvr.ca/)](http://www.yvr.ca/) and land in the Victoria International Airport (**YYJ**) [(http://www.victoriaairport.com/)](http://www.victoriaairport.com/).
  1. You may take a taxi or the SkyTrain from downtown Vancouver to YVR. The **Canada Line** Skytrain from the **Waterfront** or **Vancouver City Centre** station will take you towards the airport, but be mindful don't hop on trains towards Richmond. [(https://www.translink.ca/)](https://www.translink.ca/Schedules-and-Maps/SkyTrain/SkyTrain-Schedules/Canada-Line.aspx).
  2. After arriving in YYJ, there are car rental service, shuttle bus and city bus that runs between the airport and the Victoria city [(http://www.victoriaairport.com/taxi-and-shuttle)](http://www.victoriaairport.com/taxi-and-shuttle).
* By driving. Please drive toward the **Tsawwassen** Ferry Terminal and cross to the **Swartz Bay** terminal on the island, from where you can take the BC-17 highway to get to the city and University of Victoria. As the ferry service could be very busy during friday and weekends, we recommend you make a **Reservation** with **BC Ferries** [(https://www.bcferries.com/)](https://www.bcferries.com/travel_planning/) to ensure a smooth ride.   
* By taking public transit. You can ride the **Canada Line** to the **Bridgeport** station and take the **620** bus to reach the **Tsawwassen** ferry terminal, and board the BC Ferry towards Victoria. After disembark the ferry, take the **70** bus for downtown Victoria.

## Accommodation

As a renowned tourist destination, Victoria B.C. hosts many great accommodation options, particularly around the downtown and inner harbour areas. In addition to searching for accommodation using your preferred hotel-booking platforms, please also take a look at **[Tourism Victoria](https://www.tourismvictoria.com/stay)**, an official tourism portal maintained by the city. Most hotels in the downtown area have direct bus connections to the conference venue.

Our conference dinner will be hosted in **[Delta Hotels Victoria Ocean Pointe Resort](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yyjvo-delta-hotels-victoria-ocean-pointe-resort/)**. Due to the small number of attendees of Expressive'18 we will only have regular booking prices with this hotel, but staying there will keep you close to the events in Saturday afternoon.

As the conference date is close to the September semester, on-campus accommodation is not available for Expressive'18, therefore please search for accommodation options around the downtown area of Victoria B.C.

If there are any difficulties in securing accommodation for the conference, or find transportation between airport/ferry terminal to your hotel, please directly contact the conference committee at [expressive2018@uvic.ca](mailto:expressive2018@uvic.ca).
