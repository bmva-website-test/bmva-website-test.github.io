Hey everyone,


it's about time... The official Expressive 2018 website has gone live!

We are in the middle of organizing and defining things for this year's conference in Victoria, BC, Canada. Because of this, we will successively integrate additional information once available, so stay tuned!

We hope you are as excited as we are about this year's conference! We all look forward to receive and review your cutting-edge research and artwork.

The deadlines have been set, so make sure to check out the [Call for Submissions](2018/submissions/) and [Submission Instructions](2018/instructions/) to submit on time!

Keep being expressive!
